# Student Mental Health Analysis and Prediction 

Welcome to the Student Mental Health Analysis and Prediction. This repository is part of my course assignment and showcases the results of a comprehensive exploration into the mental health of students using data from Kaggle. The project serves as both an academic assignment and an opportunity to apply and demonstrate valuable skills in data analysis, data visualization and machine learning.

## Project Overview

As educational institutions are increasingly recognizing the importance of student mental health, this project seeks to contribute to the ongoing conversation. By leveraging data-driven insights, I aim to understand the factors that influence student mental health and create predictive models to identify potential mental health concerns early on. This work has the potential to positively impact the lives of countless students by enabling timely support and interventions.
