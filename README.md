# Student Mental Health Analysis and Prediction


Welcome to the Student Mental Health Analysis and Prediction project. This repository showcases the results of a comprehensive exploration into the mental health of students using data from Kaggle. The project serves as both an academic assignment and an opportunity to apply and demonstrate valuable skills in data analysis, machine learning, and more.

## Project Overview

As educational institutions are increasingly recognizing the importance of student mental health, this project seeks to contribute to the ongoing conversation. By leveraging data-driven insights, we aim to understand the factors that influence student mental health and create predictive models to identify potential mental health concerns early on. This work has the potential to positively impact the lives of countless students by enabling timely support and interventions.
